# fraud-detection-model
Model to detect fraud

A two person project, we created a classifier model to determine fraud. We then created a basic website with a MongoDB database to hold incoming data, which was scraped every ten minutes.

Our model output was printed to the screen upon request, with the updated information.

A presentation on our process and our model is included.
