# fraud-detection-model
Model to detect fraud

A two person project, we created a classifier model to determine fraud. We then created a basic website with a MongoDB database to hold incoming data, which was scraped every ten minutes.

Our model output was printed to the screen upon request, with the updated information. We are unable to share this due to privacy issues.

Jupyter Notebooks:
EDA on the original data & specific Natural Language Processing EDA (which pushed the oob_score to 97%!) 

Python Files:
Functions used in cleaning the data, creating the model, and prepping and comparing incoming data.
ModelX - creates the model.
App - used to run in the web browser.
